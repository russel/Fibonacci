# Fibonacci

This repository contains the _fibonacci_ function, a function to deliver the nth value in the Fibonacci
Sequence:

    f(0) = 0
    f(1) = 1
    f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)

coded with a number of different algorithms/implementations in various languages. The purpose is not to
provide Fibonacci as a Service (FaaS), but it to investigate data-driven testing (both example based and
property based) in the various languages.

## See Also

Rosetta Code is possibly the premier location of examples of coding. For _fibonacci_ see
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence They are concerned only with the code of the algorithm, the
point of this repository is as much the tests as the algorithms.
